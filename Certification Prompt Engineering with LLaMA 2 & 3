### 🧠 Prompt Engineering with LLaMA 2 & 3

This repository showcases my learning journey through the **Prompt Engineering with LLaMA 2 & 3** certification.  
It covers best practices for designing effective prompts, optimizing instruction clarity, and adapting strategies for open-weight large language models.

[View Credential](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/ee7722d1-99fa-4926-8d21-000d61d5fc7f?usp=sharing)

## 🧩 What I Learned
- Structuring prompts for LLaMA 2 & 3
- Context management and few-shot learning
- Role prompting & system instruction techniques
- Handling model hallucinations and controlling outputs
- Performance differences between LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
- Meta’s LLaMA 2 & 3 open models
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Python (prompt testing scripts)
- Playground & notebook environments

## 🤖 Why It Matters
Prompt engineering is the invisible bridge between human intention and model response.  
Understanding how to speak to models — especially open-weight ones like LLaMA — is a critical skill in building transparent, reliable, and ethical AI applications.
